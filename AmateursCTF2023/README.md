# Amateurs CTF 2023

I played Amateurs CTF 2023 as a solo team, coming 8th place overall. I ended up solving 43/64 challenges (not including the rules and survey challenges), from all sorts of different categories.


I don't have time to do writeups of all the challenges, but I'll select some of the most interesting ones.
